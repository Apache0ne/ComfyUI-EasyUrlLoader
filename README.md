# EasyUrlLoader
A simple YT downloader node for ComfyUI using video Urls. 
Can be used with VHS nodes etc.
Needed a faster way to download YT videos when using comfyUI and testing new tech. 
Video Downloads will be stored inside folder with node, needed when finding the FPS of the youtube vide. 
Will get the best resolution for the video so works great when running a video through a CN for a vid2vid pass.
