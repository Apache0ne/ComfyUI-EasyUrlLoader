# EasyUrlLoader
A simple YT downloader node for ComfyUI using video Urls. \
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30501d79-6073-4653-8eaf-452ebc7fd719)\
Needed a faster way to download YT videos when using comfyUI and testing new tech. \
Video Downloads will be stored inside folder with node, needed when finding the FPS of the youtube vide. \
Will get the best resolution for the video so works great when running a video through a CN for a vid2vid pass. \
